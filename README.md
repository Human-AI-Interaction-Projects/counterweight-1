Despite having access to more information than ever before in history, we live in a world of divided ideologies and narrowed perspectives. <br />

Whether attributed to social network algorithms which suggest only news reinforcing certain perspectives, targeted ads by agencies to continuously feed their ideological bases, or simply user habit that cause recurring visits to the same news sources, internet users easily fall into dangerous echo-chambers, which at scale, cause the sharding and deterioration of communities. <br />

This is why we want to introduce Counterweight, a Google Chrome extension to help remedy these issues. 
Based on an article the user is currently reading, Counterweight can present other perspectives on the topic by suggesting articles from different news sources across the political spectrum covering the same event. <br />
